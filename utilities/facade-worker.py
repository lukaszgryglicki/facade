# This script is responsible for cloning new repos and keeping existing repos up
# to date. It can be run as often as you want (and will detect when it's
# already running, so as not to spawn parallel processes), but once or twice per
# day should be more than sufficient. Each time it runs, it updates the repo
# and checks for any parents of HEAD that aren't already accounted for in the
# repos. It also rebuilds cache data for display.
#
# If for whatever reason you manually update the affiliations table in the
# database, be sure to run with the -n flag to "nuke" all existing affiliation
# data. It will be rebuilt the next time facade-worker.py runs.
